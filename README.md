A Transforming Fashion Retail: Empowering Customers with AI-Enabled Personal Styling and Virtual Try-On

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
The rise of online shopping has transformed the retail industry, allowing customers to conveniently browse and purchase products from the comfort of their homes. However, when it comes to fashion e-commerce platforms, customers often encounter significant challenges that impact their shopping experience. One of the most prevalent issues faced by online shoppers in the fashion industry is the difficulty in finding the right fit and style that matches their unique preferences and body type.

Traditional brick-and-mortar stores offer the advantage of trying on clothes before making a purchase, allowing customers to assess the fit, feel the fabric, and make informed decisions. However, this crucial element of the shopping experience is lost in the online realm, leading to a lack of confidence and uncertainty among customers when selecting clothing items. The absence of personalized assistance and recommendations exacerbates the problem, as customers are left to navigate vast product catalogues with limited guidance.

Moreover, customers often struggle with accurately determining their size when shopping online. Size charts and generic size descriptions do not always align with individual body measurements, resulting in ill-fitting garments and dissatisfaction. This discrepancy between standard sizes and individual body shapes leads to a significant increase in return rates, adding to the operational costs of fashion e-commerce platforms and negatively impacting profitability.

Furthermore, customers crave a sense of style and want to explore new fashion trends and outfit combinations. However, without personalized recommendations and fashion advice, customers are left to their own devices, sifting through an overwhelming array of options with limited knowledge of what suits them best. This lack of guidance and inspiration hinders customers from discovering new styles and limits their ability to express their fashion preferences.

In summary, the problem statement revolves around the need for an enhanced online shopping experience in the fashion industry. Customers require a solution that addresses the challenges of finding the right fit, offers personalized recommendations, and empowers them to confidently explore and experiment with various styles. Overcoming these obstacles is crucial to improving customer satisfaction, reducing return rates, and driving sales growth for fashion e-commerce platforms.

# CONCLUSION
In this project, we have presented a novel framework for fashion recommendation that is driven by data, visually related and simple effective recommendation systems for generating fashion product images. The proposed approach uses a two-stage phase. Initially, our proposed approach extracts the features of the image using CNN classifier ie., for instance allowing the customers to upload any random fashion image from any E-commerce website and later generating similar images to the uploaded image based on the features and texture of the input image. It is imperative that such research goes forward to facilitate greater recommendation accuracy and improve the overall experience of fashion exploration for direct and indirect consumers alike.
